Project:

Create the Book Finder application
Requirements:
Create an application that allows you to use the Google Books API to search for books. You may need to signup with google to get a API key; read the documentation for more information.

This application should allow you to:
1. Enter a query in a search box
2. Display a list of books matching the given query.
3. Each item in the list should include the book's author, title, and publishing company, as well as a picture of the book.
4. From each list item, you should also be able to navigate to more information about the book, but this information does not necessarily need to appear on a page within your application. In other words, this could link out to an external site with more information about that particular book.

Key Concepts to Learn:
Making API calls and dealing with edge cases
Bonus:

For more advanced users, please consider incorporating the following:
Test units
Handling of edge cases, for example: loading and error messages from API, not allowing API calls when query is empty, putting a timeout on a API call and letting the user know.
